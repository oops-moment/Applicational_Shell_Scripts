# Applicational_Shell_Scripts
## Using scripts in real life helps one understand the essence of learning and understanding them so here are my shell scripts as solutons to following implementation requirement
- 1: Starting from the current directory, add extension .try to all the files in the current directory, as well as all the child directories and so on. Make sure you DO NOT rename the script file itself. If some file already has an extension, still add .try to that, e.g., a file named
a.txt will be converted to a.txt.try.
- 2:  Print all Fibonacci numbers that are strictly less than 100. Make sure each number is in a new line, and they are in increasing order. Assume the first 2 numbers of the Fibonacci series as 1.
